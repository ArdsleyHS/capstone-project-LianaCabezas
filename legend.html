        <p>Back Cover:</p>
        <p>Once Known as the Western coast of the United States, the Republic is now a nation perpetually at war with its neighbors, the Colonies. </p>
        <p>Born into an elire family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a military prodigy. Obedient, passionate, and committed to her country, she is being groomed for success in the Republics highest circles.</p>
        <p>Born into the slums of the Republic's Lake Sector, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem. </p>
        <p>From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths -- until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered, and Day becomes the prime suspect. Now, caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June tries desperately to avenge Metias's death. </p>
        <p>But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths to which their country will go to keep its secrets.</p>
        <p>Full of nonstop action, suspense, and romance, Marie Ku has written an exhilarating first novel that is sure to move readers as much as it thrills.</p>
